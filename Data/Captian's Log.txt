Finished program to extract Life Expectancy data.  Found there were gaps in data coverage.
Worked on digitizing Memphis TN.  Ran into problem creating polygons.  Postulated the resolution was not high enough.

Decided to pursue other data for physical health from 500 cities data.  Will need to justify use of other data, but will 
solve the issue of data gaps.  Narrowed it down to 2 possible implementations.  Either use the self-reported survey for
physical health, or use the 5 unhealthy behaviors provided to create a physical health indication.  We are currently 
leaning towards using the survey as it will be simpler.

Got feedback from Bill.  Need to fix paper throughtout and update our metric of physical health.  Changed the conceptual 
and implementation diagram to reflect measure of physical health.
NOTE: Chose to exclude islands from Boston MA analysis.
Started working on Model Builder in ArcMap
Next step is to calculate centroids for census tracts.  Consider editing data processing python code to use pre-existing
centroid (geolocation column) for analysis.  Just need to seperate into latitude and longitude columns.

Tim worked on the paper, going over edits.
I started identifying which mean (arithmetic or geometric) to use for data.

For outliers; choices:
Move to median; instead of analysis of varience, kruskall wallace? would work
Bill suggests using Kruskall Wallace method.
Calculate means with or without outliers.  Document the difference.  State what you're doing and why.
