Finished program to extract Life Expectancy data.  Found there were gaps in data coverage.
Worked on digitizing Memphis TN.  Ran into problem creating polygons.  Postulated the resolution was not high enough.

Decided to pursue other data for physical health from 500 cities data.  Will need to justify use of other data, but will 
solve the issue of data gaps.  Narrowed it down to 2 possible implementations.  Either use the self-reported survey for
physical health, or use the 5 unhealthy behaviors provided to create a physical health indication.  We are currently 
leaning towards using the survey as it will be simpler.
