Finished program to extract Life Expectancy data.  Found there were gaps in data coverage.
Worked on digitizing Memphis TN.  Ran into problem creating polygons.  Postulated the resolution was not high enough.

Decided to pursue other data for physical health from 500 cities data.  Will need to justify use of other data, but will 
solve the issue of data gaps.  Narrowed it down to 2 possible implementations.  Either use the self-reported survey for
physical health, or use the 5 unhealthy behaviors provided to create a physical health indication.  We are currently 
leaning towards using the survey as it will be simpler.

Got feedback from Bill.  Need to fix paper throughtout and update our metric of physical health.  Changed the conceptual 
and implementation diagram to reflect measure of physical health.
NOTE: Chose to exclude islands from Boston MA analysis.
Started working on Model Builder in ArcMap
Next step is to calculate centroids for census tracts.  Consider editing data processing python code to use pre-existing
centroid (geolocation column) for analysis.  Just need to seperate into latitude and longitude columns.

Tim worked on the paper, going over edits.
I started identifying which mean (arithmetic or geometric) to use for data.

For outliers; choices:
Move to median; instead of analysis of varience, kruskall wallace? would work
Bill suggests using Kruskall Wallace method.
Calculate means with or without outliers.  Document the difference.  State what you're doing and why.

Tim worked on the paper.  Says he made the edits.
Forgot to save my work.  :(

Redid extraction of centroids from 500 cities data.
Tim worked on projecting city data.
I worked on the model builder.  It's almost done.  Just some issues with the selection.

The damn model builder is still giving me problems.  For some reason, attempting to select by location is failing.  
So my good, fair, and poor distance tracts are not correct.  Excellent distance always seems to work though.  Go figure.

I started on calculating the median for attributes instead, because I hate what I'm doing now.

Another day, another nickel.  Here we go again.
Jk, I'm not being paid for this.

Omg, the selection is working!  Just had to copy the selection results to a shape file, then transfer those to a layer 
for each selection.

Created tool to separate into good and poor health based on median calculated in csv file.

Tim is continuing to work on projecting the data.
